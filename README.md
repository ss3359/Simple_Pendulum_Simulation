# Simple_Pendulum_Simulation
This is a project simulating motion of a Pendulum using the Runge-Kutta Methods for solving a system of differential equations. This is executed in Java 


# Pendulum Simulation

This project simulates the motion of a simple pendulum using numerical methods. The simulation is based on the second-order differential equation governing the pendulum's motion, which is reduced to a system of first-order nonlinear equations. The solution is computed using the Runge-Kutta method (RK4) for numerical integration.

## Features

- Simulates pendulum motion using first-order nonlinear equations
- Solves the system using the Runge-Kutta method (RK4)
- Configurable initial angle and mass of the pendulum
- Option to add damping forces to simulate air resistance or friction
- Outputs position and velocity of the pendulum over time

## Requirements

To run this project, you need to have Java 8 or higher installed.
